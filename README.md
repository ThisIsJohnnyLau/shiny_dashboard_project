# Dashboard Project
Web traffic analysis for client

https://thisisjohnnylau.shinyapps.io/shiny_dashboard_project/

## Project aims and learning objectives

### Technical
* Data cleaning, wrangling and manipulation  
* Data visualisation  
* Dashboard design  
* R Shiny  
* APIs/Keys   
* Synthetic data  

### Practical

* Experience working in a data team  
* Understanding some of the challenges this creates and finding ways to overcome them
* GitHub for a multi-person project with branches and merging  
* Capturing business requirements and translating them into a plan with deliverable goals  
* Best practice data security  

## Planning

* Confirming MVP, extension tasks and deliverables
* Sharing the workload and effective decision making
* Supporting each other to make sure everyone gets the most out of the experience e.g. meeting learning goals
* Morning stand ups to update on progress/blockers
* Regular Git commits and use of branches with merging  
* API data needs to be synthesised for confidentiality for integration into personal Github
* Checking against Google Analytics figures and for reasonableness of results. 

## Dashboard specifications

* Built in R Shiny
* Best practice design
* Meets business requirements and **answers the business question**  


## Presentation

15 minutes as a group, plus time for questions to unveil your dashboard:

* Functionality and components  
* Approach taken and how it was planned within the group  
* Design challenges and justification of final design decisions  
* Insights captured from the data in the process of preparing the dashboard and any recommended actions  
* Enhancements for follow on work  
* Lessons for the future

## Additional points

* Sort out your data access early  
* Identify and investigate any unknowns early (gives plenty time to investigate or for you to speak to business to owners to clarify)  
* Put a time limit on aspects of the project to ensure that you have something to demonstrate at the end of the week  
* Consider investigating features in a separate test project or branch to check you can implement your plan, before integrating it into your main project.  
* Split your shiny app into ui.R and server.R files so that they can be worked on separately.
* As priority focus on the data provided as part of the brief, but if have time may wish to explore adding open data which may be relevant to your brief.   
* Think about how structure code for API calls - both in terms of number of calls but also for when replace it with synthesised data.
